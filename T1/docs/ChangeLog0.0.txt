  First fixes in 3.59:

1. 3.58 bug:
*************
  I checked the old enough Perfecto's report that right mouse click on
a map start giving you "Cannot add more objects." later in the game.
  Here is a reason why it happens.
  The next !!OB command: H,M,D,E,S,R add another object in the ERM
internal structures anyway EVEN if you use a check syntax
(!!OB...:H?v10;). So later in the game, the internal table is
overflowed and a player gets the message. This is how it works now.
  I will fix the problem with checking syntax in 3.59 or earlier (if
we make a new executable for the patch), but now I think that it is
quite important to check all scripts that uses mentioned !!OB command
to make sure that they are not used with checking syntax too often.
  If you have something to say here, I am listening :-)
*************
  Now OB:H,M now should not add an internal object if you use a
check/get syntax.
  Now if you check/get a hint zvar with OB:H for an object that has no
hint settings, it returns 0 (and do not add the object to the table).
  The easiest way to check the fix is to use !!OB...:H?$; in long
cycle (say 100000 times). You should not get the message that there is
no more room in the internal table.

2. Crash fix.
  If you play RoE campaign (not WoGified), goes to the next map and
one of heroes keep new WoG artifact, there was a crash.
  Now should be fixed.

3. I found a potential error in my code that removes an object from a
map (in particular removing a drawing squares). It might be a reason
of incorrect drawing of some dwellings sometimes.

4. The bug with Arrow Towers in MP mode:
*************
  Also Tower Experience may work incorrect (different damage) if:
- it is the first day of a week;
- you attack another human player who's turn is after yours.
  The problem appears because for you the enemy towers get experience
bonus of a new week but for your opponent they did not yet.
  This may be fixed with hard coded changes only.
*************
  Should be fixed now.

5. <3.59 bug:
*************
  If you use in the third parameter in HE:C0 any variable index -1 or
-2 (in your case y-1 or y-2) it is interpreted as -1 and -2 (some old
code left) and so works as an upgrade/downgrade syntax.
  So until it is fixed in the next EXE, you may not use a negative
indexes of variables in HE:C0 command at a third place.
  Example:
!!HE-1:C0/0/?y-1/?y-4; incorrect (assumed C0/0/-1...)
!!HE-1:C0/0/?y-2/?y-4; incorrect (assumed C0/0/-2...)
!!HE-1:C0/0/?y-3/?y-4; correct
!!HE-1:C0/0/?y-4/?y-1; correct
!!HE-1:C0/0/?y-4/?y-2; correct
!!HE-1:C0/0/?y-4/?y-3; correct
*************
  Should work correct way now.

6. Timothy's wish:
*************
TP> Here's an example:
TP> !!HE-1:C0/0/d/d/?y1/12;
TP> I believe y1 returns stack 0's experience and not the rank,
*************
  Now if the modifier is >=10 and you use C0 get syntax to get the
stack experience, it returns an experience level.

  All changes are not tested!


*********************************************************************
  Some changes.

  These are changes are mostly for MP mode for Horn will test these
features on the upcoming tournaments before 3.59 release.

1. Now all dialogs that are used to fill waiting with creature
movement animation shows only WoG creatures. Usually you can see them
when "Host generating map..." or "Waiting for other players..." and so
on.

2. Fixed network MP time SoD bug.
  When you pass turn to the next player and there is a turn time
limit, the timer starts count down immediately that your PC gets
control but not you press the button "your turn...".
  Now timer starts count down when you press the button not earlier
and will wait for it forever.

3. New receiver !!TL Turn Limit Control.
  Commands:
  E$ - turn "show left time always" ON(1) or OFF (0).
    If you turn it ON, it will shows seconds left always but not tle
latest 10 seconds as usual.
  C# - control turn time run(0) or pause(1)
    The latest command works. So you can call "pause it" 10 times but
call "continue" one time and it will run. So no calling stack present.
  T#/$ - time routine
   # = 0, $ = current time in ms (get/set/check)
   # = 1, $ = current time in s (get/set/check)
   # = 2, $ = turn start time in ms (get/set/check)
   # = 3, $ = turn start time in s (get/set/check)
   # = 4, $ = pause start time in ms (get/set/check)
   # = 5, $ = pause start time in s (get/set/check)
   # = 6, $ = turn length time in ms (get/set/check)
   # = 7, $ = turn length time in s (get/set/check)
  Now how it works.
  When a player gets control, the current time is stored in "turn start time". Then every second the engine checks that:
  current_time - turn_start_time < turn_length
  If it is false, the turn ends.
  Now if you go to battle, the timer is paused. At this moment the current time is stored in "pause start time".
  Until "pause start time" is not 0, the turn will continue.
  Hint: to check if the turn paused or not, get "pause start time" and if it is 0, the timer runs but if it is 0, the timer is paused.
  When the timer continues (the battle is finished) "turn start time" is modified to reduce spent time for a length of the pause:
  turn_start_time = current_time - pause_start_time + turn_start_time
  and pause_start_time is set to 0.


  To discuss.
  I found a way to show any internal message/request dialog
(IF:M,IF:Q) no longer than a fixed time. Say you ask a player "Do you
want ...?" and this dialog will wait for a player answer no more than
10 seconds than leave with a default answer.
  Do we need this feature?
  And if yes, how to incorporate this time to the ERM commands a
better way for scriptwriters?

*********************************************************************
1. I disabled one call to avoid opening minimap to the first human
hero before it gets a control. In original SoD first you can see the
latest AI hero location and then it moves to a new human hero or town
location. The problem is that now we have a lot of ERM executable code
between these two events and it looks a bit incorrect that you can see
the latest AI location.
  Now the first minimap update should not apper.

2. I fixed a check/get syntax for OB:M
  It may return nonsense value if there is no this object setting
before.

3. OB:H returns now 0 for check/get syntax if this object was not set
before.
