2. Now I added a way to have up to 100 local functions per script.
The syntax is the same as for calling a global function but the
index is negative like this.

!?FU-5; start local function -5
...

!!FU-5:P...; call a local function -5

Index may be from -1 to -100.
The difference between global and local functions is the scope.
Local function is searched ONLY in the current (where the call found)
script body.
This means that you may have function -5 in many scripts but when
the call is executed only functions -5 in the calling script will be
executed.
Also it gives a specific functionality.
Say you have two scripts: 23 and 456.

Script 23 has:
!?FU-34; #1
...

!?FU657;
!!FU-34:P...;
...

!?FU-34; #2
...

Script 456 has:
!?FU-34; #3
...

!?TM6;
!!FU-34:P...;
!!FU657:P...;
...

!?FU-34; #4
...

Now say timer 6 executed. The ERM interpreter will find a trigger
body (!?TM6) in the script 456.
So first !?TM6 section is executed.
Call to FU-34 will execute function #3 and then #4 because both of
them are located in the script that call is executed (script 456).
Then call to FU657 will move the current call scope to the script 23
because the body of the global function 657 is located there.
So now call to FU-34 will execute functions #1 and #2.

This means that all local functions are independent and may be
cross referenced only through the global function calls.

3. HE:A1/... fix.
Now commands like:
!!HE-1:A1/?y-2/y-1; [Check for weekly creature artifacts]
will not produce an error message.

4. 3.58f bug fix. Minotaur King now should have positive moral always.
